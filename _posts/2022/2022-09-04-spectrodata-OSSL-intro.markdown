### Introduction

In December 2021 the [Open Soil Spectral Library (OSSL)](https://explorer.soilspectroscopy.org) was launched by [soilspectroscopy.org](https://soilspectroscopy.org/) (sometimes also called [soil.spectroscopy 4 global good](https://soilspectroscopy.org)). This post is just a short introduction including a set of links to different resources related to soil spectroscopy and OSSL.

### Soil.Spectroscopy

[Soil.Spectroscopy](https://soilspectroscopy.org) and the Soil.Spectroscopy 4 global good (SOILSPEC4GG)  is a USDA-funded Food and Agriculture Cyberinformatics Tools Coordinated Innovation Network. The project brings together soil scientists, spectroscopists, informaticians, data scientists and software engineers to overcome some of the current bottlenecks preventing wider and more efficient use of soil spectroscopy. A series of working groups will be formed to address topics including calibration transfer, model choice, outreach & demonstration, and use of spectroscopy to inform global carbon cycle modeling.

SOILSPEC4GG major outputs:

- [OSSL database (mongodb)](https://soilspectroscopy.github.io/ossl-manual/index.html#ossl-mongodb)
- [Software (GitHub)](https://github.com/soilspectroscopy/)
- [Soil spectroscopy literature list 2021](https://soilspectroscopy.github.io/ossl-manual/index.html#suggested-literature)

### OpenGeoHub (OGH)

Article [Open Soil Spectral Library first release](https://opengeohub.org/article/open-soil-spectral-library-first-release/) by Tom Hengl published 22 December 2021.

### Woodwell Climate Research Center

Artcle [Introducing the Open Soil Spectral Library](https://www.woodwellclimate.org/open-soil-spectral-library/#) by Jonathan Sanderman published 6 December 2021.

### OSSL

Various OSSL related resources:

- [OSSL manual](https://soilspectroscopy.github.io/ossl-manual/)
- [OSSL viewer](https://explorer.soilspectroscopy.org)
- [OSSL engine / calibration service](https://engine.soilspectroscopy.org)
- [OSSL API](https://api.soilspectroscopy.org)
- [OSSL documentation and source code](https://github.com/soilspectroscopy)

### Retrieving OSSL data

There are several possible routes for accessing the OSSL data but this blog only covers the Online API explorer.

### Online API

The online API contains two entries, 1) an engine for entering data into the database and 2) an [Explorer](https://explorer.soilspectroscopy.org) for searching and retrieving data. The [next post](../spectrodata-OSSL-api-explorer/) in this blog outlines how to use the OSSL Explorer API.
